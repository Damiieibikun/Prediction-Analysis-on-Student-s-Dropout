# Prediction Analysis on Student's Dropout
A Data science project on Predicting Student's dropout using Machine Learning classification models

### Introduction ###
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using machine learning classification algorithms to identify students who are likely to drop out. By leveraging data on student demographics, academic performance, socio-economic factors, and other relevant variables, we aim to build a robust predictive model that can effectively forecast the likelihood of student dropping out. This model can then be used by educational institutions to allocate resources, implement early intervention strategies, and support at-risk students.

### Problem ###
In today's educational landscape, student retention and success are of utmost importance for educational institutions. Identifying students who are at risk of dropping out and implementing timely interventions can greatly contribute to improving graduation rates and ensuring academic success. 
What are certain factors that may affect student's retention or dropout in academic institutions?

### Methodology Approach ###
The methodology adopted during the course of this project include
* Data collected through [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention). 
* Data processing and descriptive analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis using Python visualization tools to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends.
* Predictive analysis using Machine Learning Classification algorithms.

### Dependencies ###
* Data Wrangling and processing Libraries
    * Pandas
    * Numpy
* Visualization Libraries
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
* Machine Learning Libraries
    * Scikit Learn

### Deliverables ###
* Comprehensive Jupyter notebooks containing codes and results

### Findings/Results ###
Through analysis, it is deduced that several factors are to be considered when predicting the students retention/dropout (not limited to):
* Age at enrollment
* Tuition fees up to date
* Debt
* Grades for Curricular units 1st and 2nd semester
* Approved units for 1st and 2nd semester
* Scholarship holders
* Parents's occupation

Out of five classification algorithms, the ones that performed best after several tries include:
* Support Vector Classifiers
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
